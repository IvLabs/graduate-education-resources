3\. You will get almost everything in U.S. So, try to get stuffs that are not available in US.  Those stuffs goes into suitcase first ( Indian Spices, your mom's recipe books, pressure  cooker, ..). So, the idea is to create the list of items and assign priority to that. Pack items  into suitcase accordingly.  

4\. Tie a colorful ribbon on the suitcase handle. It will be much easier to identify your  suitcase in the baggage claim area.  

5\. Try to avoid bringing oily stuffs ( hair oil, pickles, home made oily foods...) I had very bad  experience and had to throw away an entire suitcase. At U.S. Customs, they pricked a  hole into couple of thick plastic bags with pickles and when the baggage reached home, 

oil was floating upto 2 inched height in the suitcase. All the new dress, spices, and so  many things worth Rs 20,000 to 25,000 had to be thrown away.  

6\. Usually, you will make a huge list, buy all the stuffs and when you pack it and weight, it  will come to 30+ kgs. Priority in the list will help you to decide which items to remove.  7. If you have 10 pairs of socks, see where you can stuff the socks or use it to wrap masala  items or try to insert the socks into shoes, so it will save space.  

8\. Don't try to arrange things in suitcase, whatever you arrange, it will be in messed up  order when you get it in U.S.  

9\. Try to get the weigh scale where you can hang the suitcase using a thick rope. Other  weigh techniques will not give you accurate weight. Hang the weigh scale to your roof  using chain/rope and weight the suitcase. I have tried so many ways, but finally ended up  following the above way.  

10\. If in case you got small suitcase and find it hard to fit the stuffs, use a vacuum cleaner  to suck the air out, it will shrink and will give you more space. 

Please don't not pack the following items while flying to USA. You are wasting your luggage space  and you an get those things here.

All the new dress, spices, and so many items  had to be thrown away.
